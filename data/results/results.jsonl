If you're using an earlier version, you'll need to use a different approach, such as using the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM (\n  SELECT SALARY\n  FROM nba_roster\n  WHERE SALARY IS NOT '--'\n  ORDER BY SALARY DESC\n) AS subquery) AS \"99th Percentile Salary\";\n```\n\n", "sql_query": "SELECT PERCENTILE(SALARY, 0.99) AS \"99th Percentile Salary\"\nFROM nba_roster\nWHERE SALARY IS NOT '--';"}

Here's the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT PERCENTILE(SALARY, 0.75) AS seventy_fifth_percentile_salary\nFROM nba_roster\nWHERE SALARY!= '--';\n```\n\nThis query calculates the 75th percentile of the salaries in the `nba_roster` table, excluding rows where the salary is '--' (which represents missing values). The result is stored in the `seventy_fifth_percentile_salary` column.", "sql_query": "SELECT PERCENTILE(SALARY, 0.75) AS seventy_fifth_percentile_salary\nFROM nba_roster\nWHERE SALARY!= '--';"}
