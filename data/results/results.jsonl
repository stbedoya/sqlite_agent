Then, you can use the PERCENTILE function to find the 99th percentile.\n\nHere is the SQLite query that does this:\n```sql\nSELECT PERCENTILE(salary, 0.99) AS \"99th Percentile Salary\"\nFROM (\n  SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(SALARY, INSTR(SALARY, '$') + 1) AS INTEGER) AS salary\n  FROM nba_roster\n  WHERE SALARY!= '--'\n) AS salaries;\n```\nHere's how the query works:\n\n1. The subquery selects the salary column from the nba_roster table, but only for rows where the salary is not equal to '--'. It uses the SUBSTR function to extract the numeric value from the salary text, starting from the character after", "sql_query": "SELECT PERCENTILE(salary, 0.99) AS \"99th Percentile Salary\"\nFROM (\n  SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(SALARY, INSTR(SALARY, '$') + 1) AS INTEGER) AS salary\n  FROM nba_roster\n  WHERE SALARY!= '--'\n) AS salaries;", "num_output_tokens": 232, "num_input_tokens": 101}

We then filter out the rows where the salary is '--' (i.e., null). Finally, we use the PERCENTILE function to calculate the 99th percentile of the remaining salaries.\n\nNote that the PERCENTILE function is only available in SQLite 3.25 and later.

Here is the query:\n```\nSELECT PERCENTILE(SALARY, 0.99) AS \"99th Percentile Salary\"\nFROM nba_roster\nWHERE SALARY IS NOT NULL;\n```\nThis query calculates the 99th percentile of the salaries in the `nba_roster` table, excluding any rows where the `SALARY` column is null. The result will be the 99th percentile salary.\n\nNote: The PERCENTILE function is only available in SQLite 3.25 and later versions. If you are using an earlier version, you can use a workaround using the `SELECT` statement and the `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` clauses, like this:\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM (\n  SELECT SALARY, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS rank\n  FROM nba_roster\n  WHERE SALARY IS NOT NULL\n", "sql_query": "SELECT PERCENTILE(SALARY, 0.99) AS \"99th Percentile Salary\"\nFROM nba_roster\nWHERE SALARY IS NOT NULL;", "num_output_tokens": 223, "num_input_tokens": 101}

We can do this by using the PERCENTILE() function in SQLite. However, the PERCENTILE() function is only available in SQLite 3.25 and later versions. Since you didn't specify the SQLite version, I'll provide a solution using the percentile_cont() function from the statistics extension, which is available in SQLite 3.25 and later versions.\n\nFirst, you need to enable the statistics extension in your SQLite database. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n```sql\nsqlite>.load ext/misc/percentile.so\n```\n\nNow, you can use the percentile_cont() function to calculate the 99th percentile salary.
